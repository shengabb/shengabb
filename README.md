## Hi there, I'm Abby ðŸ‘‹
I'm a first-year Master of Environmental Studies student at UPenn and a recent BSc. graduate in Economics from LSE. Growing up in both China and the UK, I bring an international perspective to my work. Currently, Iâ€™m the Environmental Economics Graduate Research Fellow at the Water Center at UPenn, where I combine my passion for data analysis with a focus on ESG metrics and ROI analysis in infrastructure projects. You can learn more about me on my [website](https://abbysheng.netlify.app/).
